**A simple Pokédex application using data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).**

![PokeAPI logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/media/master/logo/pokeapi_256.png)

## Features

- Fetches data for the original 151 Pokémon (Generation I).
- Displays detailed Pokémon information, including:
  - Names in English and Japanese.
  - Types, stats, and moves.
  - Bios/Flavor texts from games.
- Responsive design with light and dark themes.
- Multi-language support (English and Japanese).
- Search functionality to find Pokémon by name or ID.
- Interactive UI for viewing Pokémon details.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend/Logic**: Python for fetching and processing data from the PokéAPI.
- **Testing**: Python's unittest and pytest modules for API validation.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kiefertaylorland/pokedex.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pokedex
    ```

3.  **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**

    This helps manage project dependencies without affecting your global Python installation.

    *   Create a virtual environment (e.g., named `venv`):
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```
        (Use `python -m venv venv` if `python3` is not available)

    *   Activate the virtual environment:
        *   On macOS and Linux:
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        *   On Windows (Git Bash or similar):
            ```bash
            source venv/Scripts/activate
            ```
        *   On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
            ```bash
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        Your command prompt should now indicate that you are in the `(venv)` environment.

    *   **Important:** Ensure `venv/` (or your chosen virtual environment directory name) is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Host the application locally:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    (Use `python -m http.server 8000` if `python3` is not available)

6.  **Open a web browser and navigate to:**

    ```bash
    localhost:8000
    ```

7.  **Stop the local server** once you are done exploring the application:

    Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

8.  **Deactivate the virtual environment** when you're finished working:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## Usage

- Use the search bar to find a Pokémon by name or ID.
- Toggle themes and language using the buttons in the header.
- Click on a Pokémon card to view detailed information.

## Data Source

This project uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data.

- The file `pokedex_data.json` contains pre-fetched data for the original 151 Pokémon. It is generated by running the data fetch scripts in Python and is used by the frontend for fast, offline access.

## UI Testing

Run UI tests to ensure the interface behaves as expected.

These tests require Selenium and a compatible browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver):

Test cases include:

- Verifying the Pokédex interface loads correctly.
- Testing the search bar for filtering Pokémon.
- Ensuring the Pokémon detail view displays and hides properly.
- Validating the theme toggle button switches between light and dark modes.
- Testing the language toggle button switches between English and Japanese.

To run UI tests:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_ui.py
```

## API Testing

The project includes both unit tests and integration tests for API interactions.

Integration tests require network access and may run slower due to deliberate rate limiting.

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests with mock API responses:

```bash
pytest tests/test_pokeapi_fetch.py
```

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests that make real API calls (use sparingly to avoid rate limiting):

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_pokeapi_integration.py
```

## Running All Tests and Coverage

You can use the Makefile for convenience:

```bash
make test         # Runs all tests with pytest
make coverage     # Generates a coverage report
```

## Future Enhancements

- Expand to include Pokémon from other generations.
- Add a database for offline data storage.
- Improve the UI/UX for mobile devices.
