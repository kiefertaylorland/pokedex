**A simple Pokédex application using data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).**

![PokeAPI logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/media/master/logo/pokeapi_256.png)

## Features

- Fetches data for the original 151 Pokémon (Generation I).
- Displays detailed Pokémon information, including:
  - Names in English and Japanese.

  - Bios/Flavor texts from games.
- **Smooth Transitions & Animations**:
  - Fluid modal transitions with backdrop blur effects
  - Staggered content animations for stats and moves
  - Card click animations with scale transformations
  - Hardware-accelerated animations for optimal performance
- **Enhanced User Experience**:
  - Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space to open, Escape to close)
  - Focus management for accessibility compliance
  - Body scroll prevention when modal is open
  - Click animation feedback on interactive elements
- Responsive design with light and dark themes.
- Multi-language support (English and Japanese).
- Search functionality to find Pokémon by name or ID.
- Interactive UI for viewing Pokémon details.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend/Logic**: Python for fetching and processing data from the PokéAPI.
- **Testing**: Python's unittest and pytest modules for API validation.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kiefertaylorland/pokedex.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pokedex
    ```

3. **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**

    This helps manage project dependencies without affecting your global Python installation.

    - Create a virtual environment (e.g., named `venv`):

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

        (Use `python -m venv venv` if `python3` is not available)

    - Activate the virtual environment:
        - On macOS and Linux:

            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```

        - On Windows (Git Bash or similar):

            ```bash
            source venv/Scripts/activate
            ```

        - On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):

            ```bash
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```

        Your command prompt should now indicate that you are in the `(venv)` environment.

    - **Important:** Ensure `venv/` (or your chosen virtual environment directory name) is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

4. **Install dependencies:**

    With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Host the application locally:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

    (Use `python -m http.server 8000` if `python3` is not available)

6. **Open a web browser and navigate to:**

    ```bash
    localhost:8000
    ```

7. **Stop the local server** once you are done exploring the application:

    Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

8. **Deactivate the virtual environment** when you're finished working:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## Usage

- Use the search bar to find a Pokémon by name or ID.
- Toggle themes and language using the buttons in the header.
- Click on a Pokémon card to view detailed information.

## Data Source

This project uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data.

- The file `pokedex_data.json` contains pre-fetched data for the original 151 Pokémon. It is generated by running the data fetch scripts in Python and is used by the frontend for fast, offline access.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all functionality including smooth transitions and UI interactions.

### Automated Test Runner (Recommended)

Use the automated test runner that handles HTTP server management:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

The test runner will automatically:

- Start an HTTP server on port 8001
- Run all 34 tests (20 core + 9 transition + 5 UI tests)
- Stop the server when tests complete

Additional options:

```bash
python run_tests.py --help                 # Show all options
python run_tests.py --keep-server          # Keep server running after tests
python run_tests.py --port 8080            # Use custom port
python run_tests.py tests/test_ui.py -v    # Run specific test file with verbose output
```

### Manual Testing

If you prefer to manage the server manually:

1. Start the HTTP server:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8001
   ```

2. Run tests in another terminal:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

### Test Coverage

- **API Tests**: Unit and integration tests for PokéAPI interactions
- **UI Tests**: Selenium tests for interface functionality
- **Transition Tests**: Specialized tests for smooth animation features

Test categories include:

- Pokédex interface loading and responsiveness
- Search functionality and filtering
- Pokemon detail view with smooth transitions
- Theme and language toggle functionality
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Modal animations and focus management
- Card click animations and hover effects

## API Testing

The project includes both unit tests and integration tests for API interactions.

Integration tests require network access and may run slower due to deliberate rate limiting.

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests with mock API responses:

```bash
pytest tests/test_pokeapi_fetch.py
```

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests that make real API calls (use sparingly to avoid rate limiting):

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_pokeapi_integration.py
```

## Running All Tests and Coverage

You can use the Makefile for convenience:

```bash
make test         # Runs all tests with pytest
make coverage     # Generates a coverage report
```

## Future Enhancements

- Expand to include Pokémon from other generations.
- Add a database for offline data storage.
- Improve the UI/UX for mobile devices.
