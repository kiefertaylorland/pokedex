### Bug Description
Pokemon numbered #899 through #1025 display generic placeholder names (e.g., 'ポケモン899', 'ポケモン900') with incorrect 'ノーマル' (Normal) typing instead of their actual Pokemon names and types.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Pokédex homepage
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the Pokemon list
3. Observe Pokemon #899 onwards

### Expected Behavior
- Should display actual Pokemon names (e.g., 'Wyrdeer' for #899, 'Kleavor' for #900)
- Should show correct Pokemon types
- Should have complete Pokemon data

### Actual Behavior
- Pokemon show as 'ポケモン899', 'ポケモン900', etc.
- All incorrectly typed as 'ノーマル' (Normal)
- Missing actual Pokemon identification data

### Environment
- Affected Pokemon: #899-1025 (Gen 8-9 Pokemon from Legends: Arceus and Scarlet/Violet)
- Data Language: Japanese (ポケモン)

### Examples
| Number | Shows As | Should Be |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| #899 | ポケモン899 | Wyrdeer (アヤシシ) |
| #900 | ポケモン900 | Kleavor (バサギリ) |
| #1025 | ポケモン1025 | Pecharunt (モモワロウ) |

### Technical Details
Possible causes:
1. Incomplete data source for Gen 8-9 Pokemon
2. Missing Japanese translations in the dataset
3. PokeAPI data not fully loaded
4. Data fetching stops/fails partway through

### Impact
- **Critical severity**
- Makes Pokedex completely unusable for identifying modern Pokemon
- 127+ Pokemon affected (#899-1025)
- Users cannot look up or identify these Pokemon
- Significantly reduces value as a reference tool

### Suggested Fix
1. Verify data source includes complete Pokemon data through #1025
2. Ensure Japanese translations are available
3. Add error handling for missing data
4. Consider fallback to English names if Japanese unavailable
5. Add data validation to catch placeholder content
